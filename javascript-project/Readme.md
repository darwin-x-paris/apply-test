# 🚀 Let the journey begin

You've been working at Darwin X for a while.

For several reasons, you have to work on this project.

Bad news, your colleague is not available to help you.

The CTO gave you these instructions :

```
We have a client who wants to show a map of his customer's location. The frontend is done. 

The client sent a JSON file with mock data corresponding to the data he as about his users.

 - This is a POC project. Not suitable for production.
 - You must create a web server
 - Use sqlite as a local db, KISS
 - Put this into a Docker container
 - Create an endpoint `[POST] /users/` to add an array of users with data like mock.json
 - Create an endpoint `[GET] /users/` to get a list of users in DB
 - We should be able to sort data by any field
 - 
 - The frontend needs the latitude/longitude for each user returned to put them onto a map

```

## 👷‍♂️ What shall I do ?

Finish this project. This is a POC, it should take about 30 minutes to do.

What if this project comes to production ? 
What should be done to make it production ready ?
What would you do better ?

You will answer these questions during the interview, have a nice test 🔥
